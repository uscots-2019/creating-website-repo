## Creating a Github Organization

Github allows for users to set up organizations where you can place material without it being all in your own github repository. This allows for some nice functionality:

- Separates out personal content from your organization or class materials. 
- Allows for additional administrators to have full access to repos. 
- Allows for easy transfer of ownership. 


### How do we  create one?


1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.

<br>
<br>

8. Skip the prompt to "invite members" to your organization (select "Continue")
    - students will NOT be "members" of the organization
    - students will become "outside collaborators" when later added through GitHub Classroom
